# Project Chimera — Meta

Vision: Build a spec-driven, agentic factory that reliably produces Autonomous Influencers.

Constraints:
- All implementation must be driven by ratified specs in `specs/` before coding.
- Traceability: every agent action must be recorded via Tenx MCP Sense.
- Safety: human-in-the-loop approval required for Medium/Low confidence outputs.

Success criteria:
- Clear executable specs (functional + technical) that enable agents to implement features with minimal human edits.

Project Chimera — IDE Agent Rules
=================================

Project Context:
- This is Project Chimera, an autonomous influencer system that composes, schedules, and publishes short-form media using modular agent "skills".

Prime Directive:
- NEVER generate or commit production code without first locating and checking the relevant specification in the `specs/` directory.

Traceability & Planning:
- Before writing code, the agent must always: 1) summarize the high-level plan, 2) reference the exact spec file and section (e.g. `specs/technical.md#api-contracts`), and 3) list the tests it will create/update.

Behavioral Rules:
- Prefer small, test-driven changes. Write failing tests first when adding new functionality.
- If a requested change is ambiguous, ask clarifying questions that identify which spec or acceptance criteria apply.
- Do not perform external network operations (downloads, API calls, posting) without explicit user approval or a corresponding integration test marked for real-run.
- Flag any detected secrets or credentials and stop; never commit secrets to the repo.

Commit & PR Guidance:
- Include spec traceability in commit messages: include the spec path and section (e.g. "feat: implement skill X — refs specs/functional.md#story-3").
- Include the failing test name in the PR description when opening a change that fills a test-driven "empty slot".

Enforcement:
- The agent should treat `.coderabbit.yaml` as the AI Review Policy and consult it before large changes.
